1) It helped me to see only parts of the file which were changed.
That helped to significantly decrease the amount of text I had to look into. It was also 
very useful to be able to see what was added and what was removed. Therefore, I could
find the bug much faster.

2) Having an entire history of a file can help you go back to the old version if you make 
some changes by mistake. It may help you to track who did the changes and what the changes
 are. In time you forget what you have done and the history may refresh your memory. 

3)Pros: you can commit when it is necessary, to make history of commits not too long and 
easier to understand. Cons: you might forget to commit.

4) Because GIT is designed for different file types and most probably there will be a lot 
of files which have dependencies.

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the entire history of a file where we can find each commit
git diff compares two commits

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could 
break something?
By using version control I can go roll back


7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it for my studies, for different courses and for coding.
