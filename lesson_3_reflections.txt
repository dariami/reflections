1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When more than one person is working on a project and we need to share our work. Also if 
Im working from different places I would want to have a remote repository.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if Im working on the same file which might get committed changes from someone else 
and these changes are pulled automatically I might get confusion and conflicts for example.
I might not want to update something yet.
