1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When more than one person is working on a project and we need to share our work. Also if 
Im working from different places I would want to have a remote repository.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if Im working on the same file which might get committed changes from someone else 
and these changes are pulled automatically I might get confusion and conflicts for example.
I might not want to update something yet.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
Forking is making a copy of someones else repository in github. You are able to make changes and 
commit but it wont make changes on someones else repository, only on your fork.
Clone is a copy of repository from github to your local machine.
Branch is a copy of master where you can test or implement new feature separately.
