1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When more than one person is working on a project and we need to share our work. Also if 
Im working from different places I would want to have a remote repository.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if Im working on the same file which might get committed changes from someone else 
and these changes are pulled automatically I might get confusion and conflicts for example.
I might not want to update something yet.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
Forking is making a copy of someones else repository in github. You are able to make changes and 
commit but it wont make changes on someones else repository, only on your fork.
Clone is a copy of repository from github to your local machine.
Branch is a copy of master where you can test or implement new feature separately.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you want to have all the latest changes to work on them later and for example you will
not have internet to pull, it is good to fetch the changes.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?
Would have to set up a review meeting or ask to do a review offline. Then make changes 
if necessary. During the meeting would know about needed changes immediately and could 
implement them right away. Harder to track.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
When I try a new feature or fixing a bug it is better to do it in a separate branch.
It is easier to pull and push and merge directly to master. But having changes on separate
 branch is less risky.
